VisionDrive
VisionDrive is a computer vision application that processes video streams to detect vehicles, recognize number plates using Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and estimate vehicle speed. It leverages the power of YOLOv5 for real-time vehicle detection and EasyOCR for recognizing number plates, offering an automated solution for intelligent vehicle monitoring.

Features
Vehicle Detection: Detects vehicles such as cars, trucks, and buses in real-time using the YOLOv5 model.
License Plate Recognition: Recognizes vehicle license plates using EasyOCR, even in noisy or low-quality frames.
Speed Estimation: Estimates the speed of vehicles using pixel movement between frames and calculates speed in km/h.
GPU Support: Supports running on GPU for faster inference with both YOLOv5 and EasyOCR, ensuring real-time performance.
